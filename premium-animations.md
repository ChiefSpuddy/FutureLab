## How To Choose the Best Animation

When selecting your animation, consider:

1. **Color Scheme Match** - Choose animations that use blues and purples to match your site's gradient
2. **Loading Time** - Some animations are larger than others; test loading performance
3. **Message Alignment** - Pick an animation that represents your services (web/app development)

## Implementation Tips

For maximum impact:

1. Increase the animation size:
   ```css
   .lottie-container {
       height: 500px;
       width: 100%;
   }
   ```

2. Add a subtle background glow:
   ```css
   .lottie-container {
       filter: drop-shadow(0 0 20px rgba(76, 201, 240, 0.3));
   }
   ```

3. Add interactivity on hover:
   ```javascript
   lottieContainer.addEventListener('mouseenter', () => {
       animation.setDirection(-1); // Play in reverse on hover
       animation.play();
   });
   
   lottieContainer.addEventListener('mouseleave', () => {
       animation.setDirection(1); // Play normal on mouse leave
       animation.play();
   });
   ```

Simply replace the animation path in your script.js file with any of these premium animation URLs for an immediate visual upgrade.
